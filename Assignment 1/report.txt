OS LAB ASSIGNMENT 1
PROCESS MANAGEMENT REPORT

Student Name: Dev
Roll No.: 2301730073
Course: Operating Systems Lab
Experiment No.: 1
Topic: Process Creation and Management Using Python OS Module

-----------------------------------------
1. OBJECTIVE
-----------------------------------------
The objective of this experiment is to understand how processes are created, managed, and monitored in a Linux environment using Python. The program simulates process creation using fork(), executes commands, demonstrates zombie and orphan processes, reads process information from /proc, and shows priority scheduling using nice values.

-----------------------------------------
2. TOOLS & CONCEPTS USED
-----------------------------------------
• Python 3
• os.fork()
• os.execvp()
• os.wait()
• os._exit()
• /proc filesystem
• Process IDs (PID, PPID)
• nice() for priority
• subprocess / system commands

-----------------------------------------
3. TASK SUMMARY
-----------------------------------------

Task 1: Process Creation
- Created N child processes using os.fork()
- Each child printed PID and parent PID
- Parent waited for all children

Task 2: Command Execution
- Child processes executed Linux commands (ls, date, ps)
- Output displayed successfully

Task 3: Zombie & Orphan Process
- Zombie created by skipping wait() in parent
- Orphan created when parent exited before child
- Verified zombie using "ps -el | grep defunct"

Task 4: /proc Inspection
- Read process information from /proc/[pid]
- Displayed status, executable path, file descriptors

Task 5: Priority Scheduling
- Multiple children ran CPU-heavy loops
- Different nice values used (0, 5, 10)
- Lower nice value completed first

-----------------------------------------
4. OBSERVATIONS
-----------------------------------------
• Each child process received a unique PID
• Parent-child relationship was clearly visible
• Zombie process remained in memory until parent terminated
• Orphan process was adopted by PID 1 (systemd)
• Priority affected execution speed of child processes
• /proc directory provided detailed runtime information

-----------------------------------------
5. SAMPLE OUTPUT HIGHLIGHTS
-----------------------------------------
• Child PID and Parent PID printed correctly
• Linux commands executed inside child processes
• Zombie process shown as "defunct"
• Process details displayed:
  - Name
  - State
  - Memory usage
  - Executable path
  - Open file descriptors
• Priority scheduling order observed:
  1. nice = 0
  2. nice = 5
  3. nice = 10

-----------------------------------------
6. CONCLUSION
-----------------------------------------
This experiment successfully demonstrated process creation and management in Linux using Python. The tasks helped in understanding how fork(), exec(), wait(), zombie/orphan states, and priority scheduling work at the OS level. The /proc filesystem provided valuable information about running processes. Overall, the experiment strengthened the understanding of process lifecycle and scheduling in operating systems.

-----------------------------------------
7. LEARNING OUTCOMES
-----------------------------------------
• Understood how processes are created and managed
• Learned the difference between parent and child processes
• Observed zombie and orphan behaviors in real execution
• Gained knowledge of /proc filesystem
• Understood scheduling impact using nice values
