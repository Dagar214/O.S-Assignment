--------------------------------
Explanation of Output
--------------------------------
• The program simulates a system startup
• Three processes were created:
  - Process-1
  - Process-2
  - Background-Service
• Each process executed a task (2-second delay)
• Logging recorded the start and end time of each process
• All processes completed successfully
• System shutdown message printed

--------------------------------
Observed Behavior
--------------------------------
✅ Processes started concurrently
✅ Logging captured timestamps and process names
✅ Log file generated automatically
✅ System shut down gracefully after process completion

--------------------------------
