TASK 4: INSPECT PROCESS INFO FROM /proc
=======================================

Input:
Enter PID to inspect: 12455

Output:
Name:   python3
State:  R (running)
VmSize:  32768 kB
VmRSS:   12400 kB

Executable Path:
/usr/bin/python3.10

Open File Descriptors:
['0', '1', '2', '3']

=====================================
TASK 5: PROCESS PRIORITIZATION (nice)
=====================================

Output:
--- Task 5: Priority Scheduling Demonstration ---
Child PID 12470 running with nice=0
Child PID 12471 running with nice=5
Child PID 12472 running with nice=10

Execution Observed:
Child with nice=0 finished first
Child with nice=5 finished second
Child with nice=10 finished last

Conclusion: Higher nice value reduces CPU priority.
