OPERATING SYSTEM LAB REPORT

============================================
Experiment Title: Process Creation and Management Using Python OS Module
========================================================================

Course: ENCS351 – Operating System
Program: B.Tech CSE (AI & ML)

============================================

1. AIM
   ============================================
   The aim of this experiment is to understand Linux process creation and management by simulating system calls such as fork(), exec(), wait(), and nice() using the Python OS module.

============================================
2. OBJECTIVES
=============

• To create child processes using os.fork().
• To understand parent–child process relationships.
• To execute Linux commands using exec().
• To simulate zombie and orphan processes.
• To inspect process information using the /proc file system.
• To study scheduling effects using process priority (nice values).

============================================
3. THEORY
=========

3.1 Process
A process is a program in execution. Each process has a unique Process ID (PID) assigned by the operating system.

3.2 fork()
fork() is a system call used to create a new process. It creates a child process that is an exact copy of the parent process.

3.3 exec()
The exec() call replaces the current running process with a new program. It does not create a new process.

3.4 Zombie Process
A zombie process is a process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table because the parent has not called wait().

3.5 Orphan Process
An orphan process is a process whose parent has terminated while the child is still running. It is adopted by init (PID 1).

3.6 /proc File System
/proc is a virtual file system that provides information about running processes.

3.7 nice()
The nice value defines the priority of a process. Higher nice value means lower priority.

============================================
4. ALGORITHM
============

1. Import required modules (os, time, subprocess).
2. Create child processes using fork().
3. Display PIDs and PPIDs.
4. Execute system commands using execvp().
5. Simulate zombie and orphan processes.
6. Read process details from /proc directory.
7. Assign different nice values to child processes.
8. Observe scheduling behavior.

============================================
5. SOURCE CODE
==============

(Refer to process_management.py file)

============================================
6. OUTPUT
=========

(Refer to output.txt file for detailed outputs of all tasks)

============================================
7. RESULT
=========

The experiment was successfully executed. Process creation, command execution, zombie and orphan states, process inspection, and scheduling behavior were observed correctly.

============================================
8. CONCLUSION
=============

This experiment provided hands-on understanding of Linux process management. It helped in learning how operating systems create and manage processes and schedule CPU time effectively.
